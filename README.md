ALGORITHM USED: RANDOM FOREST

WHAT IS Random Forest?
Random Forest is a classifier that contains a number of decision trees on various subsets of the given dataset and takes the average to improve the predictive accuracy of that dataset.
The greater number of trees in the forest leads to higher accuracy and prevents the problem of overfitting.

Why use Random Forest?
1.It takes less training time as compared to other algorithms.
2.It predicts output with high accuracy, even for the large dataset it runs efficiently.
3.It can also maintain accuracy when a large proportion of data is missing.

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:
1.Data Pre-processing step
2.Fitting the Random forest algorithm to the Training set
3.Predicting the test result
4.Test accuracy of the result (Creation of Confusion matrix)
5.Visualizing the test set result.
